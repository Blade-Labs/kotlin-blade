### App structure

Demo app uses BottomNavigationView with 3 tabs, loading different fragments. 
Every fragment have controls and output section. In output section app shows serialized result of method call and execution time.

On Init fragment there are fields for Blade SDK init and some demo data like testnet account, private key, token id and contract id.
This data temporary stores in Config object singleton. 

In every fragment on `onViewCreated` method calling `Blade.getInfo()` to check if SDK initialized and enable or disable controls

As `Blade` object is singleton it may be initialized once and use in every other fragment.
